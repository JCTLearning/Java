# Essentials Rewrote
This Folder contains any file involved in the full rewrite of the popular plugin "Essentials." Their public repository can be found here: https://github.com/drtshock/Essentials/ The whole purpose of this rewrite it to make Data management more efficient and add "aesthetics" to the plugin.
# Issues?
A lot of the management in this is "weird", didn't copy the .java files directly from a src folder(had to decompile what was made.) We can reorganize this later. Most of what is in here is written using 1.8's build path, we need to make sure this works using 1.12's file.
