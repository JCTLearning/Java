# Essentials Rewrote
This Folder contains any file involved in the full rewrite of the popular plugin "Essentials." Their public repository can be found here: https://github.com/drtshock/Essentials/ The whole purpose of this rewrite it to make Data management more efficient and add "aesthetics" to the plugin.
# Issues?
A lot of the management in this is "weird", didn't copy the .java files directly from a src folder(had to decompile what was made.) We can reorganize this later.
